# Car Price Prediction

A Python-based machine learning project that predicts used car prices using Linear Regression and Random Forest models. This project demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, outliers, and inconsistent categories.
- **Feature Engineering:** One-hot encoding, grouping of categorical variables, and normalization where necessary.
- **Machine Learning Models:** 
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RÂ² Score and RMSE to assess model performance.
- **Documentation:** Clear and well-commented code for reproducibility and easy understanding.
